## For reference purposes

- index.html is the main hub page and it works with script.js and style.css

- csfrq.html is the page with APCSA material and it works with script.js and style2.css

- portfolio.html is the page with my portfolio details that is still in the works but it works with port.js and stylePort.css

### AI was used to assist in creation due to being a beginner and lacking knowledge in coding language related to html, javascript, and css.
